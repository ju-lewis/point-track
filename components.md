# PointTrack Module components:

## MCU
ESP32-S3 WROOM-1
- Built-in PCB antenna
- Built-in 
- up to 16MB PSRAM (R16 variant)
- up to 16MB program flash

Currently, I think the best choice is `ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N16R8`, with 8MB PSRAM and 16MB flash


## GNSS Receiver
Ublox ZED-F9P
- UART config and output support

## Li-Ion battery
- 2S bat, 2x18650??? (Would provide plenty of capacity)

## Li-Ion charge controller IC


## Display
Any HD44780 compatible 16x2 display is fine
